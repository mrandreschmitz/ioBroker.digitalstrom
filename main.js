Rule 5 When applications send a scene command to a set of digitalSTROM-Devices with more than one target device they have to use scene calls directed to a group, splitting into multiple calls to single devices has to be avoided due to latency and statemachine consistency issues.

Rule 8 Application processes that do automatic cyclic reads or writes of device parameters are subject to a request limit: at maximum one request per minute and circuit is allowed.

Rule 9 Application processes that do automatic cyclic reads of measured values are subject to a request limit: at maximum one request per minute and circuit is allowed.

Rule 10 The action command ”Set Output Value” must not be used for other than device configuration purposes.

Rule 13 Applications that automatically generate Call Scene action commands (see 6.1.1) must not execute the action commands at a rate faster than one request per second.
